		<h1>Celestia</h1>
		<p>Celestia is an intra-departmental event conducted by the Society of Geo-Infomatics Engineers. It not just invites students from the department of civil, but also extends a warm welcome to any student of our college who has something to share about the wonderful world of geo-informatics. Celestia, true to its name, is an out-of-the-world experience. It serves as the perfect platform for the students to present their view points on various fields and showcase all their hidden talents. And it also provides a feeling of being at home, and serves as a guiding beacon to the students before they venture out to present their ideas elsewhere. There are various competitions organized for the masses. In short, there is something for everyone. One doesn’t have to be a book worm to win laurels over here. Below is a short description of the various competitions:</p>
		<h2>Paper presentation</h2>
		<p>If you have an unquestionable idea, and think you must share it with the world, then you have surely come to the right place. All you have to do is this-convey your thought provoking idea over here!!</p>
		<h2>Poster presentation</h2>
		<p>They say a picture conveys a thousand words. And we here at Celestia are strong believers of that. So, we’d like to welcome all those bright minds out there to share their thought with us by means of a poster. The poster can be presented on any of the following topics.</p>
		<h2>General quiz</h2>
		<p>Does anyone need an explanation??? General quiz happens to be the best crowd-puller of Celestia. All you have to do is gear yourself for an hour of some mind boggling stuff. There will be a written prelims.</p>
		<h2>Technical quiz</h2>
		<p>For all the technical minds out there-this may be what you are looking for. A quiz on all the technical stuff you have learnt (or may be not!!) over the years. The finalists will be selected on the basis of written prelims</p>
		<h2>Visual instinct</h2>
		<p>Visual instinct-the best show stopper of Celestia!! The questions always have you on your toes. It is nothing but a much more exciting version of quiz. All your questions will be based on images. The questions can be anything under the sky…or may be even above it.</p>
