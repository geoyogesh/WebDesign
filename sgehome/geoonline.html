		<h1>GeoOnline</h1>
		<h2>“Exploring the spatial realms”</h2>
			<p>A mission set and a vision forged. GeoOnline (<b>GO</b>) is an online endeavour by students of Society of Geoinformatics Enigneers ( SGE), Anna University, to bridge student communities, research groups and industries in the geo-spatial domain.</p>
			<p>A distinguished mélange of out of the box works, it publishes videos, tutorials, papers and research works that range dynamically from something very simple to something extremely complex, all, not just by students of Society of Geoinformatics Engineers (SGE), but from other GEOSPATIALLY ENTHUSED minds across the world as well!</p>
			<p>GeoOnline, it wouldn’t  be right to call it a portal, it is more so an experience. An experience of a multitude of talent! GO believes that a geographic allusion to a problem ensures a better solution. GO hopes to achieve that through GeoOnline.</p>
			<p>GeoOnline is a dream. A dream that was dreamt of since ages, a dream that’s taken shape  and a dream that will linger for all eternity.</p>
			<p>GeoOnline, probably has the most youthful and diverse team that has taken a liking to the ever growing and ever green geospatial arena. </p>
			<p>GeoOnline is an existence. An existence to be touched, heard and felt, an existence that could good do you a load of good, an existence that is the culmination of a wealth of geospatial information.</p>
			<p>So get ‘GO’ing!</p>

		<h1>SHARE</h1>
			<p>You can share your videos, contents supporting those videos and general tutorials and presentations that you feel are useful for the Geospatial community. The range of topics covered here is its main advantage! Remote sensing, GIS, image processing, computer programming and virtually any topic under the sun in GEO and allied stuff are welcome. Publish and market your ideas across the global GEO network through GO!</p>

		<h1>COMMUNITY</h1>
			<p>To share ideas and Q&As and to rummage through blogs, websites and magazine portals among others to hunt down stories that help keep you in the know, everyday, you can actually start discussions on forums and maintain communities pertaining to each of the several different subjects under GO itself!</p>

		<h1>Join GO!</h1>
