			<h1>Welcome to Spectra!</h1>
			<p>In order to increase awareness of current trends in Geo-Spatial industry and to expand the activities of the Society, the Society of Geoinformatics Engineers started their very own e-magine, SPECTRA, from October 2007. This quarterly e-magazine publishes articles by the students of the Society on various aspects of Geo-Informatics.</p>
			<p>Our latest issue of the magazine was released in August 2008. Click on the links above to read on! Or get the PDF file here!</p>
			
			<h2><a href="garticles.html">gArticles</a></h2>
			<p>Geo-Articles, gArticles, in short is the section to publish various articles written/reviewed by the current students at CEG. Topics for gArticles range from surveying to photogrammetry to geodesy to GIS to higher studies ...</p>
			
			<h2>fameTalk</h2>
			<p>Fame Talk is the section of the magazine that publishes the talk of a famous personality. In each edition a person is interviewed or the talk made by that person in any of the conferences that take place in IRS or Anna University or by special appointment is published.</p>
			
			<h2>alumniTalk</h2>
			<p>Alumni Talk is the section of the journal that publishes the talk of a alumnus passed out of CEG. It contains the experiences of one alumnus each edition who are pursuing higher education or working. In each edition, a special note from the alumnus is requested and published on topics, but not limited to job prospects, industry experience, research inclination, current trends in GIS.</p>
			
    		<h2>gNews</h2>
			<p>A collection of various happenings on our favorite topics are gathered here.</p>
			
			<h2>eureka</h2>
			<p>Eureka! It is the feeling one gets after having discovered something big. We at Anna University have many Eureka! moments during our stay here. Eureka! features one thesis every edition done by the students at IRS. Beware that the following are only one among the many Eureka! moments we have had!</p>
			
			<h2>chillOut</h2>
			<p>Twenty five credits a semester can be really taxing! This section helps you to find things to distract you from the rigors of semester life. Artwork by the students are the specialty of this edition. Be on the lookout for more.</p>
